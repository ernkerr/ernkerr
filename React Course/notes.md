React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces 

Why? 
React uses JS in the browser to update the page and the UI without reloading 
- JS is able to read and manipulate a webpage after it was loaded

Why not just JS? 
- becomes cumbersome, error-prone, hard to maintain or edit, 
- react offers a simpler mental model 

As a React Devleoper, you'll write React specific JavaScript code
- using CodeSandbox: an in-browser cloud-based code editor and development environment 

index.html: 
- contains the HTML elements that are responsible for displaying most of the page

index.js: 
- responsible for getting ahold of buttons, adding click listeners, & updating the UI
